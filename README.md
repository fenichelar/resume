# resume

This is a resume with the data stored in a JSON file that is compiled using Handlebars. The HTML version is created client-side using Javascript. The PDF version is created by Unix command line manually from the HTML version and then uploaded. I plan to create a Node application to replace this version where the HTML and PDF resumes are created server side.
