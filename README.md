# resume

Resume Generator is a tool for creating a resume by compiling JSON content and HTML layout templates using JavaScript, jQuery, and Handlebars. Both an HTML and PDF version are created. The HTML version is compiled client-side using Javascript. The PDF version is created server-side by a bash CGI script from the compiled HTML version.
